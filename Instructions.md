To play the game, just run the file. You will be prompted to input the size of the grid, i.e., the number of tiles on both the axes. Enter it and the game tab will open.

The functionalities are as follows:

* To select or deselect a cell, just click on it.
* To manually advance through the generations, click on the right arrow on the keyboard.
* To zoom in, press the '+' key or the '=' key on the keyboard.  
  Note: By the '+' key, I don't mean the '+' key on the number pad, but the other one.
* To zoom out, press the '-' key on the keyboard.  
  Note: By the '-' key, I don't mean the '-' key on the number pad, but the other one.
